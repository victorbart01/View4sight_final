## **PROBLEM SECTION**

**Section Header:** Your Current Workflow is Killing Your Productivity

**Body Copy:** You're a professional. You capture incredible 3D dataâ€”point clouds, BIM models, orthophotosâ€”but then what? You're stuck installing heavy desktop software, managing licenses, and watching clients struggle to view your deliverables.

Your team wastes hours exporting static PDFs or screenshots that don't do justice to your work. Clients can't understand the full scope of your surveys. Colleagues need expensive software just to add a simple annotation.

Meanwhile, you're drowning in a mess of different tools: one for CAD, another for point clouds, a third for sharing files. Every project becomes a juggling act between incompatible software.

**Key Points:**

* Heavy desktop software that slows down your entire workflow  
* Clients who can't view or understand your 3D deliverables  
* Constant switching between expensive, incompatible tools
